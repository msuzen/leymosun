    "A mixed matrix ensemble is formed by choosing different sized matrices. Recent work on this demonstrated [Suzen21] a principled way of generating a mixed ensemble. After setting a reference $N$ matrix order, generating mixed-sizes from a Binomial distribution with re-interpretation of the probability of success as the degree of mixture. This mixture defines which new matrix orders to generate and how many.  \n",

Repeating this procedure with the ensemble size $M$ will generate the mixed ensembles matrix-orders we should generate. `mixed_ensemble` method from `leymosun` exactly do this.  "

    "\n",
    "An important detail here is, when we analyze spectra of different size matrices, we need to align their spectra to reference length, i.e., reference matrix order $N_{ref}$. The alignment is achived via replicating the spectra up to the reference order. This is also called periodic boundary conditions or cyclic sequence up to an order. We apply this cyclic order after computing the spectra of each mixed ensemble member. This procedure results in all equal lenght spectra. Analysis of density is then applied. `emprical_spectral_density` method handles this via its `mixed_order` parameter, pooling all spectra with the mixed ensemble, i.e., GOE here."
